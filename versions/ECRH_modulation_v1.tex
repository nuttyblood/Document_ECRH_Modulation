\section{Introduction}




This section needs to discuss (1) the issue to investigate (impact of ECRH heating power on turbulence), (2) antecedents and previous studies both at TJ-II and elsewhere, (3) motivation and goals of this work.

In general, when the heating power increases, heat transport must increase accordingly, since heat input must be balanced with heat output (at least in steady state). In a purely diffusive system, this means that the thermodynamic gradients must increase in proportion to the heating increase.
However, in fusion plasmas there exist various channels for heat transport: apart from losses through radiation, one has diffusive transport and anomalous (turbulent) transport. Turbulent transport tends to increase non-linearly once a gradient threshold is superseded.
Consequently, on average, transport increases more than proportionally with the heating power.
This phenomenon is called `power degradiation': namely, the plasma energy content $W$ increases less than linearly with heating power $P$: $W \propto P^{0.4}$. 
Thus, the steady-state energy confinement time decreases with heating power: $\tau_E = W/P \propto P^{-0.6}$, as reflected in the main tokamak and stellarator scaling laws \cite{ITER:2007,Yamada:2005}.
To achieve a deeper understanding of this issue, one needs to monitor both profiles and turbulence as the heating is changed.

Assuming that anomalous or turbulent transport plays a key role in confinement degradation, one would also like to understand how turbulent transport reacts to changes in heating: how fast does it respond, how does it propagate radially from the heating deposition region, are spatial correlations and correlations between fluctuating variables affected, etc. 

Previous relevant work at TJ-II: there are no TJ-II studies on ECRH modulation + turbulence analysis. 
ECRH modulation + global transport \cite{S_Eguilior_2003}. 
Probes and modulation of electrode biasing \cite{Grenfell:2019}. 
Modification of the plasma potential profile with density \cite{Melnikov:2011}: it becomes negative at the edge first.
The impact of ECRH power variations on radial transport \cite{Milligen:2018b}. `Power degradation' suggests an increased role for turbulent transport at high power.

\section{Experimental Set-up}

\section{Methods}

\subsection{TJ-II stellarator}

Describe TJ-II: parameters, heating, fueling, etc. Also, we need to summarize what we know about the electron-to-ion root transition at TJ-II. 
It occurs systematically at a critical density $n_{e,c} \simeq 0.6 \cdot 10^{19}$ m$^{-3}$
\cite{Hidalgo:2006b} \cite{Pedrosa:2008}.
As the density increases, the global potential profile goes from positive to negative, the inversion starting from the plasma edge and moving inward. This leads to the formation of a shear layer at the plasma edge and one can detect long-range correlations (between the 2 Langmuir probes), associated with zonal flows, if they are placed at the right radial position.

\subsection{Diagnostics}

Describe diagnostics: ECE, Langmuir probes, HIBP, Thomson Scattering, He-Beam, magnetics (if applicable; use previous articles and the \href{https://wiki.fusion.ciemat.es/wiki/TJ-II}{Fusionwiki} for inspiration and references).

The 2-D probe has a specific configuration that allows computing some interesting quantities, including $T_e$.
An estimate of the turbulent radial particle flux is possible $\Gamma \propto \tilde I_{sat} \tilde E_\theta$.
The probe also allows estimating the Reynolds Stress term $R = \langle \tilde E_r \tilde E_\theta \rangle$, important for the formation of transport barriers (it describes the energy transfer from fluctuations to mean flow).
This section should describe in detail how to do all that.

\subsection{Analysis Methods}

The analysis of single time traces may include the mean, RMS, Skewness, Kurtosis (of $V_f, I_{sat}, \dots$), spectra, etc. From the multipin probes, we may obtain the radial electric field $E_r$, the poloidal velocity $v_{corr} \simeq v_\theta$ \cite{Milligen:2023b}, the radial fluctuating particle flux $\Gamma \propto \tilde I_{sat} \tilde E_\theta$, the Reynolds Stress $R = \langle \tilde E_r E_\theta \rangle$, the intermittence \cite{Carreras:2020}. Profiles of these quantities. 

Radial correlations of various quantities (such as the floating potential) may provide evidence of radial propagation and its velocity. One may try radial correlation of HIBP and Langmuir potential. One may also look at Transfer Entropy.

Toroidal correlations between Langmuir probe $V_f$ measurements indicate the existence of zonal flows \cite{Pedrosa:2008}, \cite{Milligen:2015}: variation with $P_{ECRH}$ and radius.

Once we get an idea of how things change with $P_{ECRH}$ 'high' and 'low' and $n_e$ (in a few selected shots), we might also want to see {\em how fast} the plasma responds to the change in $P_{ECRH}$, and/or how these changes propagate. Do mean profiles respond before the turbulence changes? Or (more likely), does the turbulence change before the profiles do? 

\section{Experimental results}

\subsection{Experiments}


\begin{figure}[!ht]
   \includegraphics[width=264 pt]{Images/Figure1.pdf}
   \caption{Profile of $\iota/2\pi$ for the magnetic configuration 100\_44\_64, and some rotational values are indicated by horizontal dashed lines.}
   \label{Fig:Figure1}
\end{figure}

Describe experiments (day, heating power $P_{ECRH}$ +  modulation, density variation). Magnetic configuration (see Fig. \ref{Fig:Figure1}).
Clarify that high $n_e$ means low $T_e$, hence high collisionality. This will affect transport.

Distinguish between shots with different line average densities: below, at, and above the `critical density' of $n_{e,c} \simeq 0.6 \cdot 10^{19}$ m$^{-3}$.
A few representative time traces are shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:Densities_1}.
This figure is rather interesting and key to this study: The time traces with $n_e \simeq n_{e,c}$ seem to show that it is possible to create and destroy the edge transport barrier using ECRH modulation!

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{Images/Densities.eps}
   \caption{Density traces of some shots with ECRH modulation, showing the resulting modulation of $n_e$. ECRH switching times are indicated by vertical dashed lines. The critical density $n_{e,c} \simeq 0.6 \cdot 10^{19}$ m$^{-3}$ is indicated by a horizontal dashed line. Shots 50030 and 50040 have $n_e < n_{e,c}$ and the density modulated in counter-phase with $P_{ECRH}$. Shots 50047 and 50048 have $n_e \simeq n_{e,c}$ and in at least one time interval, the density increases rapidly due to improved confinement associated with an edge transport barrier. This rapid increase happens during a $P_{ECRH}$ off state; in this state, the density (gradient) rises slightly, which may trigger the barrier. Shot 50043 has $n_e > n_{e,c}$ and reversed $n_e$ modulation (50038 has at least one similar modulation period, following the establishment of the edge transport barrier, indicated by a period of rapid increase of the density).}
   \label{Fig:Densities_1}
\end{figure}

Preliminary classification of shots (to be checked/improved):
\begin{itemize}
\item $n_e < n_{e,c}$: 50019-50030, 50037, 50039-50040
\item $n_e \simeq n_{e,c}$: 50031-50036, 50041-50042, 50044-50048, 50050-50053. The confinement transition is visible as a noise on the interferometry time trace \cite{Milligen:2011}.
\item $n_e > n_{e,c}$: 50038, 50043
\end{itemize}

The GR modulation leads to a separate classification:
\begin{itemize}
\item shot $\le$ 50037: GR on axis
\item 50038 $\le$ shot $\le$ 50052: GR off axis
\item shot $\ge$ 50053: GR2 on axis
\end{itemize}

Present an inventory of these experiments, showing profiles for both heating phases (ECRH on/off), for all classes of mean $n_e$ above. Profiles may include: ECE, Thomson Scattering, HIBP, Langmuir (and maybe Helium beam). Avoid transitionary states immediately following ECRH switching times.

\subsection{Thomson Scattering profiles}

Document the Thomson Scattering profiles, and see to which modulation phase they correspond (see script plot\_Thomson.m). For example, Fig. \ref{Fig:Thomson} shows mean Thomson Scattering $T_e$ profiles during the ECRH on and off phases, for shots with on-axis modulation.

When scanned, you can obtain the $\Phi$ and $I_{tot}$ profiles for ECRH on/off; when not scanned, one can perhaps study correlation with Langmuir.
Figs. \ref{Fig:HIBP_Phi} and \ref{Fig:HIBP_Phi2} show examples (see script HIBP\_profile.m).
The scanning periods do not coincide exactly with the ECRH modulation periods, so sometimes, ECRH changes during a scan, which is visible in the figure.

\subsection{Electron Cyclotron Emission}

ECE allows following the spatiotemporal evolution $T_e(\rho,t)$ in the core plasma region, provided $n_e$
is below the cutoff density.
ECE is cross-calibrated against Thomson Scattering.
Fig. \ref{Fig:ECE} shows an example for low density; see script ECE\_analysis.m.
The temporal response to ECRH steps is fast in the core region, but slow further out.
This slow response is due to radial transport, so this observation provides an experimental measure of the transport time scale; you can fit an exponent, $A + B\exp(-(t-t_0)/\tau)$ to the curve $T_e(t)$ following an ECRH step at $t=t_0$ to obtain the time scale $\tau$.
In the core region, $\tau$ is small because the dynamics are dominated by the immediate heating response; in the edge region, $\tau$ is large because the dynamics are dominated by transport.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{Images/ECE.eps}
   \caption{$T_e$ time traces from the ECE diagnostic. The times of ECRH switch-on and switch-off are indicated by vertical dashed lines.}
   \label{Fig:ECE}
\end{figure}

The ECRH power deposition profile can be estimated by detecting the change of slope $dT_e/dt$ immediately before and after the ECRH switching times (ignoring transport): 
$$\Delta P_{ECRH} = \Delta \left ( \frac32 \frac{d}{dt}(n_eT_e) \right ).$$ 
See Fig. \ref{Fig:ECE_deposition}.
The upward power steps yield larger changes in slope than the downward steps, as the downward steps are affected by relatively slow radial transport.
While most of the power is deposited within $\rho < 0.2$, significant power is also deposited outside the core region \cite{S_Eguilior_2003}.

NOTE: this case is off-axis ECRH (to be compared with an on-axis case). So, even with off-axis ECRH, much of the modulated power is deposited in the core, probably due to multi-pass absorption.
How much power? Can we quantify this? Maybe $P(\rho\le 0.2)/P_{tot}$, and estimate this for all shots?

\subsection{Langmuir Probe profiles}

See script plot\_Langmuir.m. [NOTE LOP17 and LOP18 are `dead'.]

Fig. \ref{Fig:Langmuir_profiles} shows edge profiles for a single shot of the series ($n_e < n_{e,c}$).
The profiles are averaged over time intervals with constant $P_{ECRH}$.
When ECRH1 is on, the floating potential is higher. The ion saturation current varies by a smaller relative amount.

Fig. \ref{Fig:Langmuir_RMSprofiles} shows edge profiles of the RMS (fluctuation amplitude) for a single shot of the series ($n_e < n_{e,c}$).
The profiles are averaged over time intervals with constant $P_{ECRH}$.
The RMS does not vary as $P_{ECRH}$ is varied.

Fig. \ref{Fig:Langmuir_profiles1} shows edge profiles for another shot of the series ($n_e < n_{e,c}$).
The profiles are averaged over time intervals with constant $P_{ECRH}$.
When ECRH1 is on, the floating potential is higher. The ion saturation current varies by a smaller relative amount.
Density $n_e$ is gradually increasing, leading to a gradual reduction of $V_f$.

Fig. \ref{Fig:Langmuir_RMSprofiles1} shows edge profiles of the RMS (fluctuation amplitude) for a single shot of the series ($n_e < n_{e,c}$).
The profiles are averaged over time intervals with constant $P_{ECRH}$.
Now a variation of RMS is seen, increasing as the density $n_e$ increases.
So: when the density approaches the critical density $n_{e,c}$, the edge turbulence amplitude increases.
(Increasing turbulence amplitude is a prelude to the formation of sheared flow at the critical density!)

To be done: profiles of Reynolds Stress, Intermittence, ...

Idea for analysis: create a database of these profiles, for each shot and each ECRH modulation interval. Then one can see more clearly and systematically how the profiles respond to $n_e(t)$ and $P_{ECRH}$.

\subsection{Turbulence}

Characterize turbulence for both heating phases (ECRH on/off), for all classes of mean $n_e$ above. Use all methods available, insofar as they yield significant results.

\subsection{Long Range Correlations}

Long Range Correlations (LRCs) are a measure of either Zonal Flows or filaments \cite{Milligen:2013b}. 
In this section, we will study how the LRC varies with (a) line average density and (b) $P_{ECRH}$.
(See script correlation\_Langmuir.m).
Fig. \ref{Fig:Langmuir_LRC} shows an example for a specific shot with $n_e < n_{e,c}$. 
The LRCs change systematically with $P_{ECRH}$ (times correspond to ECRH on/off; improve plot labeling). Note: check signal contamination (spikes in correlation $C(\Delta t)$, probably due to some low frequency oscillations in the range 1-10 kHz; of course LRCs are due to precisely that: low frequency oscillations).

\subsection{Transitions}

Present a separate analysis of what happens immediately after ECRH switching times. How fast do changes occur? How do the changes propagate radially? 

\section{Discussion}

Observation: $n_e \le n_{e,c}$: the density variation is {\em in phase opposition} with the modulation of $P_{ECRH}$. 
But in two cases with $n_e > n_{e,c}$, the density variation is {\em in phase} with the modulation of $P_{ECRH}$ (off-axis).

The modulation of $n_e$ at low $n_e$ is probably (partly) a NeoClassical effect \cite{Velasco:2012}: an increase of $P_{ECRH}$ leads to an increase of $\nabla T_e$, so that the ambipolar solution to the transport equations changes, leading to a variation in $n_e$. This effect works on the time scale of {\em transport} (i.e., it's slow, requiring several ms for changes to take effect).
The following paper may provide a means to estimate the profile evolution: \cite{Gutierrez-Tapia:2015}.
We can discuss this with Victor Tribaldos once we have documented the relevant discharges (profiles).

Also note the existence of the so-called `pump-out effect': at high $P_{ECRH}$, more ripple-trapped electrons are driven into the loss cone, thus leading to a reduction of electron density at higher power \cite{Castejon:2008}. This {\em kinetic} effect is very fast.
Yet for the case $n_e > n_{e,c}$, the density response is {\em in phase} with the variation of $P_{ECRH}$.
This is inconsistent with the `pump-out effect'.

So what could the explanation for the observations of density modulation at $n_e > n_{e,c}$?
At high density, a transport barrier exists at the plasma edge, and it becomes stronger at increased power, i.e., improving confinement at higher power [references]. If true, the observation at $n_e > n_{e,c}$  is a {\em turbulent} effect. 

Clarifying the time scales of the phenomena might help (slow $\Delta t > 1$ ms: transport-related; fast: turbulence-related).

This idea provides an orientation for this study: can we verify that turbulent transport is reduced in the edge in the high density case? How does it behave as a function of $P_{ECRH}$? We need to select (at least) three discharges, for $n_e < n_{e,c}$, $n_e \simeq n_{e,c}$ and $n_e > n_{e,c}$, and compare profiles and turbulence properties.

\section{Electron Cyclotron emission results}

Note: an example case of ECE $T_e(\rho,t)$ results could be included in the section `Experiments', in order to illustrate the $T_e$ response to modulation, but we don't need an exhaustive study of this, since our goal is turbulence analysis, for which the ECE diagnostic is too limited.
